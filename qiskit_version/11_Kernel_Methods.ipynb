    "Kernel methods are widespread in machine learning and they were particularly common before deep learning became a dominant paradigm. The core idea is to introduce a new notion of distance between high-dimensional data points by replacing the inner product $(x_i, x_j)$ by a function that retains many properties of the inner product, yet which is nonlinear. This function $k(.,.)$ is called a kernel. Then, in many cases, wherever a learning algorithm would use an inner product, the kernel function is used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that the kernel function acts as an inner product on a higher dimensional space and encompasses some $\\phi(.)$ mapping from the original space of the data points to this space. So intuitively, the kernel function is $k(x_i, x_j)=(\\phi(x_i), \\phi(x_j))$. The hope is that points that were not linearly separable in the original space become linearly separable in the higher dimensional space. The $\\phi(.)$ function may map to an infinite dimensional space and it does not actually have to be specified. As long as the kernel function is positive semidefinite, the idea works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many kernel-based learning algorithms are instance-based, which means that the final model retains some or all of the training instances and they play a role in the actual prediction. Support vector machines belong here: support vectors are the training instances which are critically important in defining the boundary between two classes. Some important kernels are listed below.\n",

    "The choice of kernel and the parameters of the kernel are often arbitrary and either some trial and error on the dataset or hyperparameter optimization helps choose the right combination. Quantum computers naturally give rise to certain kernels and it is worth looking at a specific variant of how it is constructed.\n",

    " # Thinking backward: learning methods based on what the hardware can do\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of twisting a machine learning algorithm until it only contains subroutines that have quantum variants, we can reverse our thinking and ask: given a piece of quantum hardware and its constraints, can we come up with a new learning method? For instance, interference is a very natural thing to do: we showed an option in the first notebook on quantum states, and it can also be done with a Hadamard gate. \n",
    "For this to work we need to encode both training and testvectors as amplitudes in a statevector built up out of four registers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|0\\rangle_c|00..0\\rangle_m|00..0\\rangle_i|0\\rangle_a$\n",
    "\n",
    "The amplitude of such state will be equal to the value of a feature in a training vector or test vector. To do that we use four registers. The first is a single bit, acting as the ancilla ancilla (a), which will will code for either a training (a=0) or a testvector (a=1). The second register, in the notebook example a single bit, will code for the m-th training vector. The third register, in the notebook example also reduced to a single bit, codes for the i-th feature. Lastly the class bit (c) codes for class -1 (c=0), or 1 (c=1).\n",
    "Hence, if after fully encoding all training data and test data into the state $|\\psi>$ the state |1010> has coefficient 0.46 :\n",

    "\n",

We use `angles[1]`, which is ~`1.325/2`. Why? We have to rotate the basis state $|0\\rangle$ to contain the vector we want. We could write this generic state as $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2)\\end{pmatrix}$. Looking at the documentation of the gate implementing the rotation, you'll see that the function argument divides the angle by two, so we have to adjust for that -- this is why we divided $\\theta$ by two.

The quantum AND gate is the CCX (also known as Toffoli), which flips the target qubit if both controls are 1. Applying the CCX flips only the data qbit of the target state. The subsequent rotation over half the desired angle works on all states, but after applying the second CCX the targed state has actually rotated in the opposite direction. Applying the reverse rotation adds the second half of the rotation for the target state,ans cancels the rotation for all other states (See Bloch sphere diagram outlining these 4 steps)\n",
