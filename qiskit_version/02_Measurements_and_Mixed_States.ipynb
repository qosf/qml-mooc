Most quantum computers that we have today, however, only implement one very specific measurement, which makes our discussion a lot simpler. This measurement is in the canonical basis. In other words, the measurement contains two projections, $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle 1|$, and this measurement can be applied to any of the qubits of the quantum computer.\n",

To put this in context, let us apply the projection $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$ on the superposition $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$, which is the column vector $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$."
