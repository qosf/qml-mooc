    "Unsupervised learning means a lack of labels: we are looking for structure in the data, without having an *a priori* intuition what that structure might be. A great example is clustering, where the goal is to identify instances that clump together in some high-dimensional space. Unsupervised learning in general is a harder problem. Deep learning revolutionized supervised learning and it had made significant advances in unsupervised learning, but there remains plenty of room for improvement. In this notebook, we look at how we can map an unsupervised learning problem to graph optimization, which in turn we can solve on a quantum computer.\n",

    "This matrix is sometimes called the Gram or the kernel matrix. The Gram matrix contains a fair bit of information about the topology of the points in the high-dimensional space, but it is not easy to see. We can think of the Gram matrix as the weighted adjacency matrix of a graph: two nodes represent two data instances. Their distance as contained in the Gram matrix is the weight on the edge that connects them. If the distance is zero, they are not connected by an edge. In general, this is a dense graph with many edges -- sparsity can be improved by a distance function that gets exponentially smaller.\n",
