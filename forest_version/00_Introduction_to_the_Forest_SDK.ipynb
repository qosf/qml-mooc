    "The [Forest SDK](http://docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/) is a comprehensive suite of a language allowing you to define circuits, a simulator, a collection of quantum algorithms, among other important components. For setting it up on your computer, please refer to the Forest documentation. At the time of writing, the simulator and the compiler were not open source. Here we spell out the details of Forest that are critical for the rest of the notebooks.\n",

It is better to run them from the terminal, but for convenience, we can launch them from this notebook if they are in the system path. We have to make sure that the ports we are using are available. We wrap this boilerplate code in a function that returns the process objects and a `ForestConnection` object containing the details of the ports."
