    "In the previous notebook, we showed how QAOA can approximate the ground state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ of a many-body system characterized by a Hamiltonian $H$. We connected this problem to binary optimization in computer science in notebook 4, and used this connection to understand adiabatic quantum computing and variational algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also talked about the engineering constraints we face in real devices: the evolution in these devices is actually that of an open quantum system, where the quantum processing unit interacts with the environment. In that case, the ground state of $H$ won't be a pure state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ but a density matrix $\\rho_0$\n",

    "The environment is defined by a temperature $T$, and if we let the system equilibrate, the QPU will become thermalized at temperature $T$. As we saw in the notebook on evolution in open and closed systems, the energy of the states will follow a Boltzmann distribution: $\\rho_0=\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-H/T}$ where $Z=tr (e^{-H/T})$ is a normalization factor (called the *partition function*), ensuring that $tr(\\rho_0)=1$. The inverse temperature $1/T$ is often denoted by $\\beta$, so the state can also be written as $\\rho_0=\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta H}$. If $H$ has a discrete basis of orthonormal eigenstates $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$ with eigenvalues $\\{E_n\\}$, we can write $H=\\sum_n E_n |n\\rangle \\langle n|$ and $\\rho_0=\\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_n e^{-E_n/T} |n\\rangle \\langle n|$ (since exponentiating a diagonal operator consists in exponentiating the elements of the diagonal). Hence, the thermal density matrix is a mixed state where each eigenstate of $H$ with energy $E$ has a classical probability $P(E)=\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-E/T}$, a Boltzmann distribution. We can see that the minimum energy eigenstate will have the highest probability. When $T \\rightarrow 0$, the minimum energy eigenstate will have a probability close to $1$. When $T \\rightarrow \\infty$, all the eigenstates tend to have equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question that arises now is: how to approximate this thermalized state $\\rho_0$ of the Hamiltonian $H$ using a quantum circuit? For pure ground states, there were two methods: quantum annealing and QAOA. We will see here that those two methods can be adjusted to also prepare thermalized density matrices.\n",

    "# Quantum Approximate Thermalization\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many results for preparing a thermal state on a gate-model quantum computer, but most of them need a large-scale device. More recently, a protocol for approximating thermalization was developed using shallow circuits [[1](#1)]. The idea is that if we knew that the thermal state was a pure state $\\psi$ (which means $\\rho=|\\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi |$), we could apply QAOA to get to the thermal state of a target Hamiltonian. Since QAOA approximates the adiabatic pathway, it should be a conservative change, so at the end of it, we would be close to the thermal state of the target Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the thermal state of the simple system, the trick is to purify $\\rho$ on a larger Hilbert space. If we call $\\mathcal{H_1}$ our current Hilbert space, purifying a density matrix $\\rho$ consists of finding a second Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H_2}$ such that there exists $| \\psi \\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H_1} \\otimes \\mathcal{H_2}$ such that $\\rho = \\textrm{Tr}_{\\mathcal{H_2}} \\left( |\\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi | \\right)$, where $\\textrm{Tr}_{\\mathcal{H_2}}$ is the partial trace taken over the second Hilbert space -- in essence, we are marginalizing the probability distribution. This resembles the idea of what we shown in the notebook on measurements and mixed states: if we trace out a subsystem of the maximally entangled state $|\\phi^+\\rangle$, we get the maximally mixed state. The maximally mixed state is essentially a thermal state at infinite temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that $| \\psi \\rangle =1/\\sqrt{2 \\cosh \\frac{1}{2T}} \\sum_{z \\in {-1,1}} e^{- \\frac{z}{2T}} |z \\rangle_{\\mathcal{H_1}} \\otimes | z \\rangle_{\\mathcal{H_2}}$ purifies $\\rho=\\frac{1}{Z}e^{- H_m/T}$ [[1](#1)], where $H_m$ is the mixing Hamiltonian in QAOA. This state can be built with a circuit composed uniquely of RX gates and CNOT gates.\n",
