Unitary evolution is true for a closed system, that is, a quantum system perfectly isolated from the environment. This is not the case in the quantum computers we have today: these are open quantum systems that evolve differently due to to uncontrolled interactions with the environment. In this notebook, we take a glimpse at both types of evolution.\n",

It has a very specific structure and we will revisit it, but for now, suffice to say that the energy of the samples pulled out of a thermal state follows a Boltzmann distribution.

Temperature enters the definition: the higher the temperature, the closer we are to the uniform distribution. In the infinite temperature limit, it recovers the uniform distribution. At high temperatures, all energy levels have an equal probability. In contrast, at zero temperature, the entire probability mass is concentrated on the lowest energy level, the ground state energy.
