    "Current and near-term quantum computers suffer from imperfections, as we repeatedly pointed it out. This is why we cannot run long algorithms, that is, deep circuits on them. A new breed of algorithms started to appear since 2013 that focus on getting an advantage from imperfect quantum computers. The basic idea is extremely simple: run a short sequence of gates where some gates are parametrized. Then read out the result, make adjustments to the parameters on a classical computer, and repeat the calculation with the new parameters on the quantum hardware. This way we create an iterative loop between the quantum and the classical processing units, creating classical-quantum hybrid algorithms.\n",

    "The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is shallow-circuit variational algorithm for gate-model quantum computers that was inspired by quantum annealing. We discretize the adiabatic pathway in some $p$ steps, where $p$ influences precision. Each discrete time step $i$ has two parameters, $\\beta_i, \\gamma_i$. The classical variational algorithms does an optimization over these parameters based on the observed energy at the end of a run on the quantum hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, we want to discretize the time-dependent $H(t)=(1-t)H_0 + tH_1$ under adiabatic conditions. We achieve this by Trotterizing the unitary. For instance, for time step $t_0$, we can split this unitary as $U(t_0) = U(H_0, \\beta_0)U(H_1, \\gamma_0)$. We can continue doing this for subsequent time steps, eventually splitting up the evolution to $p$ such chunks:\n",

The simplest mixing Hamiltonian is $H_0 = -\\sum_i \\sigma^X_i$, the same as the initial Hamiltonian in quantum annealing. By alternating between the two Hamiltonian, the mixing Hamiltonian drives the state towards and equal superposition, whereas the cost Hamiltonian tries to seek its own ground state.\n",
