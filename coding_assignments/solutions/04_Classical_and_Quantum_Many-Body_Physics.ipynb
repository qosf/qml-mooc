So by calculating the eigendecomposition of the typically non-diagonal Hamiltonian, we can extract both the ground state and its energy. The difficulty comes from the exponential scaling of the matrix representing the Hamiltonian as a function of the number of sites. This is the original reason going back to the early 1980s to build a quantum computer: this device would implement (or simulate) the Hamiltonian in hardware. Say, a couple of hundred spins would be beyond the computational capacity of supercomputers, but having the physical spins and being able to set a specific Hamiltonian, we can extract quantities of interest, such the ground state."
